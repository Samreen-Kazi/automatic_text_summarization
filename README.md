***Introduction***

Automatic text summarization, or just text summarization, is the process of creating a short and coherent version of a longer document.

It can be achieved using NLP(natural language processing). 


There are two main types of text summarization using NLP: 

1)Extraction-based summarization. 

2)Abstraction-based summarization.
